# Changelog for coreSNTP Library

## v1.0.0 (July 2021)

This is the first release of an coreSNTP client library in this repository.

This library implements an SNTP client for the [SNTPv4 specification](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc4330). It is optimized for resource-constrained devices, and does not allocate any memory.

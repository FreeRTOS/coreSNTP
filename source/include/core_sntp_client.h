/**
 * @brief Receives a time response from the server that has been requested for time with
 * the @ref Sntp_SendTimeRequest API function.
 * Once an accepted response containing time from server is received, this function calls
 * the user-defined @ref SntpSetTime_t function to update the system time.
 *
 * @note If the user has provided an authentication interface to the client
 * (through @ref Sntp_Init), the server response is authenticated by calling the
 * @ref SntpValidateServerAuth_t function of the @ref SntpAuthenticationInterface_t interface.
 *
 * @note On receiving a successful server response containing server time,
 * this API calculates the clock offset value of the system clock relative to the
 * server before calling the user-defined @ref SntpSetTime_t function for updating
 * the system time.
 *
 * @note For correct calculation of clock-offset, the server and client times MUST be within
 * ~68 years (or 2^31 seconds) of each other. In the special case when the server and client
 * times are exactly 2^31 seconds apart, the library ASSUMES that the server time is ahead
 * of the client time, and returns the positive clock-offset value of INT32_MAX seconds.
 *
 * @note This API will rotate the server of use in the library for the next time request
 * (through the @ref Sntp_SendTimeRequest) if either of following events occur:
 *  - The server has responded with a rejection for the time request.
 *                         OR
 *  - The server response wait has timed out.
 * If all the servers configured in the context have been used, the API will rotate server for
 * time query back to the first server in the list which will be used in next time request.
 *
 * @param[in] pContext The context representing an SNTPv4 client.
 * @param[in] blockTimeMs The maximum duration of time (in milliseconds) the function will
 * block on receiving a response from the server unless either the response is received
 * OR a response timeout occurs.
 *
 * @note This function can be called multiple times with zero or small blocking times
 * to poll whether server response is received until either the response response is
 * received from the server OR a response timeout has occurred.
 *
 * @return This API functions returns one of the following:
 *  - #SntpSuccess if a successful server response is received.
 *  - #SntpErrorContextNotInitialized if an uninitialized or invalid context is passed
 * to the function.
 *  - #SntpErrorBadParameter if an invalid context is passed to the function.
 *  - #SntpErrorNetworkFailure if there is a failure in the user-defined transport
 *  - #SntpErrorAuthFailure if an internal error occurs in the user-defined
 * authentication interface when validating the server response.
 *  - #SntpServerNotAuthenticated when the server could not be authenticated from
 * its response with the user-defined authentication interface.
 *  - #SntpInvalidResponse if the server response fails sanity checks expected in an
 * SNTP response packet.
 *  - #SntpErrorResponseTimeout if a timeout has occurred in receiving response from
 * the server.
 *  - #SntpRejectedResponse if the server responded with a rejection for the time
 * request.

 * while setting the remaining members to zero.
 * If the server has accepted the time request, then the function will set the
 * rejectedResponseCode member of the output parameter to #SNTP_KISS_OF_DEATH_CODE_NONE,
 * and set the other the members with appropriate data extracted from the response
 * packet.
 *
 * @param[in] pResponsePacket The SNTP response packet from server to parse.
 * @param[in] pRequestTxTime The system time (in SNTP timestamp format) of
 * sending the SNTP request to server.
 * @param[in] pResponseRxTime The system time (in SNTP timestamp format) of
 * receiving the SNTP response from server.
 * @param[out] pParsedResponse The parameter that will be populated with data
 * parsed from the response packet, @p pResponsePacket.
 *
 * @return This function returns one of the following:
 * - #SntpSuccess if the server response does not represent a Kiss-o'-Death
 * message.
 * - #SntpRejectedResponseChangeServer if the server rejected with a code
 * indicating that client cannot be retry requests to it.
 * - #SntpRejectedResponseRetryWithBackoff if the server rejected with a code
 * indicating that client should back-off before retrying request.
 * - #SntpRejectedResponseOtherCode if the server rejected with a code
 * other than "DENY", "RSTR" and "RATE".

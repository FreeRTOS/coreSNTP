 *

 *
 * @note The following diagram explains the calculation of the clock
 * offset:
 *
 *                 T2      T3
 *      ---------------------------------   <-----   *SNTP/NTP server*
 *               /\         \
 *               /           \
 *     Request* /             \ *Response*
 *             /              \/
 *      ---------------------------------   <-----   *SNTP client*
 *           T1                T4
 *
 *  The four most recent timestamps, T1 through T4, are used to compute
 *  the clock offset of SNTP client relative to the server where:
 *
 *     T1 = Client Request Transmit Time
 *     T2 = Server Receive Time (of client request)
 *     T3 = Server Response Transmit Time
 *     T4 = Client Receive Time (of server response)
 *
 *  Clock Offset = T(NTP/SNTP server) - T(SNTP client)
 *               = [( T2 - T1 ) + ( T3 - T4 )]
 *                 ---------------------------
 *                              2
 *
 * @note Both NTPv4 and SNTPv4 specifications suggest calculating the
 * clock offset value, if possible. As the timestamp format uses 64 bit
 * integer and there exist 2 orders of arithmetic calculations on the
 * timestamp values (subtraction followed by addition as shown in the
 * diagram above), the clock offset for the system can be calculated
 * ONLY if the value can be represented in 62 significant bits and 2 sign
 * bits i.e. if the system clock is within 34 years (in the future or past)
 * of the server time.
 *
 * @param[in] pClientTxTime The system time of sending the SNTP request.
 * This is the same as "T1" in the above diagram.
 * @param[in] pServerRxTime The server time of receiving the SNTP request
 * packet from the client. This is the same as "T2" in the above diagram.
 * @param[in] pServerTxTime The server time of sending the SNTP response
 * packet. This is the same as "T3" in the above diagram.
 * @param[in] pClientRxTime The system time of receiving the SNTP response
 * from the server. This is the same as "T4" in the above diagram.
 * @param[out] pClockOffset The calculated offset value of the system clock
 * relative to the server time, if the system clock is within 34 years of
 * server time; otherwise, the seconds part of clock offset is set to
 * #SNTP_CLOCK_OFFSET_OVERFLOW.
